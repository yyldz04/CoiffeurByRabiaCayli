# Busy Slots Multi-Day Logic Analysis

## Your Current Implementation (Already Correct!)

Your SQL logic in `get_available_time_slots` function (lines 203-208) is:

```sql
SELECT end_time
INTO v_busy_end_time  
FROM public.busy_slots
WHERE (
  -- Convert busy slot to full datetime range: busy_date + start_time to end_date + end_time
  (busy_date + start_time) < (p_date + v_end_time_str::TIME) AND 
  (COALESCE(end_date, busy_date) + end_time) > (p_date + v_time_str::TIME)
)
```

## Example Scenario Analysis

**Busy Period**: Today (2024-01-15) 15:00 → 5 days later (2024-01-20) 12:00
**Test Date**: Tomorrow (2024-01-16)
**Test Time Slot**: 10:00-11:00

### Step-by-Step Logic:

1. **Busy slot start**: `2024-01-15 15:00`
2. **Busy slot end**: `2024-01-20 12:00`
3. **Time slot start**: `2024-01-16 10:00`
4. **Time slot end**: `2024-01-16 11:00`

### Condition Check:
```sql
-- Condition 1: Busy start < Time slot end
(2024-01-15 15:00) < (2024-01-16 11:00) ✅ TRUE

-- Condition 2: Busy end > Time slot start  
(2024-01-20 12:00) > (2024-01-16 10:00) ✅ TRUE
```

**Result**: Both conditions are TRUE → **OVERLAP DETECTED** → Time slot marked as unavailable

## Why This Works for All Tomorrow's Slots:

For ANY time slot on tomorrow (2024-01-16):
- **Busy start** (2024-01-15 15:00) is always < any time on tomorrow
- **Busy end** (2024-01-20 12:00) is always > any time on tomorrow

Therefore, ALL time slots on tomorrow will be correctly marked as unavailable.

## Database Schema Support:

Your `busy_slots` table structure perfectly supports this:
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.busy_slots (
  busy_date DATE NOT NULL,      -- Start date
  end_date DATE,               -- End date (optional, defaults to busy_date)
  start_time TIME NOT NULL,    -- Start time on start date
  end_time TIME NOT NULL,      -- End time on end date
  -- ... other fields
);
```

## Conclusion:

✅ **Your implementation is already correct and handles multi-day busy periods properly!**

The logic correctly:
1. Converts date ranges to full datetime ranges
2. Checks for any overlap between busy periods and requested time slots
3. Blocks all overlapping slots regardless of date span
4. Uses `COALESCE(end_date, busy_date)` to handle single-day busy slots

**No changes needed** - your algorithm already works as intended.
