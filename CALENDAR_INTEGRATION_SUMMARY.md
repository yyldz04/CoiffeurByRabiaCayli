## 🚀 Next Steps to Go Live

### 1. Database Setup
```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL editor
-- Execute the contents of calendar-schema.sql
```

### 2. Deploy Application
- Deploy your Next.js application with the new endpoints
- Ensure environment variables are set:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

### 3. Test the Integration
```bash
# Run the test script
node test-calendar-api.js

# Or use the deployment script
./deploy-calendar-integration.sh --full
```

### 4. Create Your First Token
1. Log into admin dashboard
2. Go to "KALENDER-INTEGRATION" tab
3. Click "Neuen Token erstellen"
4. Configure permissions and copy the token

### 5. Share Calendar URLs
Your users can now subscribe to:
```
https://yourdomain.com/api/calendar/feed.ics?token=YOUR_TOKEN
```

## 🎯 User Experience

### For Administrators
- **Easy token management** through the admin dashboard
